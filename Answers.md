1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    React was created by Facebook because the amount of new data that was being pushed needed a new code that would... react to the new data. From what I understand with how much needs to update in real time react is able to run it, compared to the use of Doms which can work slower with too many set. 

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    To think in react to me means to see things a containers and set up the software by working on each individual component in the container.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    A class component uses arrow functions, can call a constructor while the functional can call in props. Both can end up doing the same task but with class working in ES6 format. 

4.  Describe state.
    I love the idea Dustin had, that a State is like a warehouse, it holds all the props inside.

5.  Describe props.
    The props in the previous statement would be like the trucks leaving the warehouse, they do not have access to the state but they are part of it.
